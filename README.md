# Dog-detector
Python script to detect dog(s) in an image

MobileNet architecture and the Single Shot Detector (SSD) framework are used for detecting dogs in an image.
The model weâ€™ll be using in this blog post is a Caffe version of the original TensorFlow implementation by Howard et al. and was trained by chuanqi305 (https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD).
The MobileNet SSD was first trained on the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context) and was then fine-tuned on PASCAL VOC.
